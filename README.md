# Slide Repository

This is repository for my talk and lecture slides. 

Each talk and lecture is in a separate folder, which can contain more than one slide. Typing the folder name as sub-url of the page, e.g. `https://www.msaidf.com/slides/folder-name`, will open the `index.html` file in the folder. 

If there is only one slide in the folder, it will most likely be the `index.html` file. If there are more than one slide in the folder, `index.html` could be the first slide or the talk or lecture home page.
